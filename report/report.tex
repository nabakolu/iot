\section{System Introduction}



Quality of Life and well-being is an essential factor for work performances and health of employees in office environments. One emerging problem of indoor office buildings are high CO2 concentrations which lead to impaired work performance and negative health symptoms \cite{indoor_polutionCO2}. Other common disturbances of indoor offices include outside noise and sunlight. Both elements distract the concentration of office workers. 
\newline
The above problems can be addressed by a smart window and shutter management system. 
This system allows the monitoring of the CO2 concentration, outside noise and sunlight.
Based on the monitoring data the system can then react by controlling the windows, shutters, heating of the office. 
\newline
The goal is in maintaining low CO2 concentration high air quality comfortable temperature and no distraction by blinding sunlight. Other weather aspects such, as wind and rain also need to be considered when controlling office windows. Additional, the influence of ambient noise has to be minimized. 




The performance and health of office employees can be increased my monitoring the CO2 concentration, aswell   

To increase the performance and health of employees an automated

For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, a book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.

\section{System Analysis}
Describe the user requirements of your system.

\section{System Architecture Design}
Describe and provide a design of the architecture of your system.

\section{System Implementation}
Describe the implementation of your system. This section is only relevant for the report and should be omitted for the project description. 

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
Here you can discuss some interesting points or limitations of your system and conclude the report.
